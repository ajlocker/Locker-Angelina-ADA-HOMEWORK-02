## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. Every Saturday, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest in the morning and listens for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number calls she will hear in that time is 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

```{r}
x <- 0:30
```

1.a. What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

``` {r}
x <- 0:30
l <- 15
a <- ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15)
eightplus <- 1-a
eightplus
```


1.b. What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

``` {r}
x <- 0:30
l <- 15
b <- ppois(q = 0, lambda = 15)
zero <- 1-b
zero
```

1.c. What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

```{r}
x <- 0:30
l <- 15
c <- dpois(x = 3, lambda = 15)
exactthree <- 1-c
exactthree
```

1.d. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

```{r}
 
x <- 0:30
l <- 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = paste0("Probability Mass Function\nlambda = ", 15))

```
 

1.e. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).


```{r}

x <- 0:30
l <- 15

two_year <- rpois(n = 104, lambda = 15)


two_year

```


1.f. Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}
two_year <- rpois(n = 104, lambda = 15)

hist(two_year, xlim=c(0,30), xlab = "Observation", ylab = "# of Calls", main = "# of Calls in Two Years of Observations")

```

2. Load in the dataset “zombies.csv” from my GitHub repository at https://github.com/difiore/ADA-2019. This data includes the first and last name and gender of the entire population of 1000 people who have survived the zombie apocalypse and are now ekeing out an existence somewhere on the East Coast, along with several other variables (height, weight, age, number of years of education, number of zombies they have killed, and college major see here for info on important post-zombie apocalypse majors

```{r}
d <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/ajlocker/Desktop/Data Analysis/zombies.csv", sep = ",", header =  TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```

2.a. Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education).
NOTE: You will not want to use the built in var() and sd() commands as those are for samples.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)


sel_data <- select(d,height, age, weight, zombies_killed, years_of_education)

describe(sel_data)

sd_height <- sqrt(sum((d$height-mean(d$height))^2)/length(d$height))
                                                   
sd_weight <- sqrt(sum((d$weight-mean(d$weight))^2)/length(d$weight))

sd_age <- sqrt(sum((d$age-mean(d$age))^2)/length(d$age))

sd_kills <- sqrt(sum((d$zombies_killed-mean(d$zombies_killed))^2)/length(d$zombies_killed)) 

sd_edu <- sqrt(sum((d$years_of_education-mean(d$years_of_education))^2)/length(d$years_of_education)) 

mean_height <- mean(d$height)

mean_weight <- mean(d$weight)

mean_age <- mean(d$age)

mean_kills <- mean(d$zombies_killed)

mean_edu <- mean(d$years_of_education)


sd_height
sd_age
sd_weight
sd_kills
sd_edu

mean_height
mean_age
mean_weight
mean_kills
mean_edu

```
 
2.b. Use {ggplot} and make boxplots of each of these variable by gender.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
abox <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = age, color = gender)) + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Age") + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
abox

wbox <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = weight, color = gender)) + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Weight") + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
wbox

hbox <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = height, color = gender)) + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Height") + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
hbox

zbox <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed, color = gender)) + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Kills") + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
zbox

ebox <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education, color = gender)) + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Education") + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
ebox

```

2.c. Use {ggplot} and make scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way? *Both height and weight, in relation to age, have positive linear correlations. Height and age is a stong(ish) positive linear correlation; weight and age is a weak positive linear correlation* 

```{r}
hscat <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = height)) + xlab("Age") + ylab("Height") + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
hscat

wscat <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight)) + xlab("Age") + ylab("Weight") + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
wscat

```

2.d. Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not? *Kills and Edu are not from normal distributions*

```{r}
hist(d$age)
hist(d$weight)
hist(d$height)
hist(d$zombies_killed)
hist(d$years_of_education)

qqnorm(d$age, main = "QQ Age")
qqline(d$age, col = "gray")

qqnorm(d$weight, main = "QQ Weight")
qqline(d$weight, col = "gray")

qqnorm(d$height, main = "QQ Height")
qqline(d$height, col = "gray")

qqnorm(d$zombies_killed, main = "QQ Kills")
qqline(d$zombies_killed, col = "gray")

qqnorm(d$years_of_education, main = "QQ Education")
qqline(d$years_of_education, col = "gray")
```


HINT: Not all are drawn from a normal distribution! For those that are not, can you determine what common distribution they are drawn from?

2.e. Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombies (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you will need to base your estimate of the CIs on some different distribution!

```{r}

k <- 1  # number of subsets taken
n <- 30  # subset size
group <- NULL  # dummy

for (i in 1:k) {
  group <- sample(1:nrow(sel_data), size = n, replace = FALSE)
}

x <- sel_data[group, ]
x
```
** means**
```{r}

hm <- mean(x$height)
hm
am <- mean(x$age)
am
wm <- mean(x$weight)
wm
zm <- mean(x$zombies_killed)
zm
em <- mean(x$years_of_education)
em
```
** standard deviations**

```{r}

hsd <- sd(x$height)
hsd
asd <- sd(x$age)
asd
wsd <- sd(x$weight)
wsd
zsd <- sd(x$zombies_killed)
zsd
esd <- sd(x$years_of_education)
esd
```

**standard errors**
```{r}
library(sciplot)
hse <- se(x$height)
hse
ase <- se(x$age)
ase
wse <- se(x$weight)
wse
zse <- se(x$zombies_killed)
zse
ese <- se(x$years_of_education)
ese
```

**confidence intervals**
```{r}
upperheight <- hm + qnorm(0.975, mean = 0, sd = 1) * hse
lowerheight <- hm + qnorm(0.025, mean = 0, sd = 1) * hse 
hci <- c(lowerheight, upperheight)
hci

upperage <- am + qnorm(0.975, mean = 0, sd = 1) * ase
lowerage <- am + qnorm(0.025, mean = 0, sd = 1) * ase 
aci <- c(lowerage, upperage)
aci

upperweight <- wm + qnorm(0.975, mean = 0, sd = 1) * wse
lowerweight <- wm + qnorm(0.025, mean = 0, sd = 1) * wse 
wci <- c(lowerweight, upperweight)
wci

upperkills <- zm + qnorm(0.975, mean = 0, sd = 1) * zse
lowerkills <- zm + qnorm(0.025, mean = 0, sd = 1) * zse 
zci <- c(lowerkills, upperkills)
zci

upperedu <- em + qnorm(0.975, mean = 0, sd = 1) * ese
loweredu <- em + qnorm(0.025, mean = 0, sd = 1) * ese 
eci <- c(loweredu, upperedu)
eci

```

2.f. Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombies out and calculate the mean for each of the these samples. Together with the first sample you drew out, you now have a set of 100 means for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of the sampling distribution for each variable? 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
k <- 99  # number of subsets taken
n <- 30  # subset size
biggroup <- NULL  # dummy

for (i in 1:99) {
  biggroup[[i]] <- sample(1:nrow(sel_data), size = 30, replace = FALSE)
}

t <- sel_data[biggroup[[i]], ]
t

y <- rbind(t, x)
y
```
**Group Means**

```{r}

mgh <- mean(y$height)
mgh

mga  <- mean(y$age)
mga

mgw <- mean(y$weight)
mgw

mgz <- mean(y$zombies_killed)
mgz

mge <- mean(y$years_of_education)
mge
```

**group standard deviations**
```{r}
hgsd <- sd(y$height)
hgsd
agsd <- sd(y$age)
agsd
wgsd <- sd(y$weight)
wgsd
zgsd <- sd(y$zombies_killed)
zgsd
egsd <- sd(y$years_of_education)
egsd
```
How do the standard deviations compare to the standard errors estimated in [2.e.]? *The standared deviations of the  the bigger group are all within the standard errors for the small group*

What do these sampling distributions look like? 
```{r}

hist(y$height, xlab = "Mean of Height", main = "Distribution of Means of Height from Simulation")
abline(v = mgh, col = "blue")  
abline(v = mean(d$height), col = "red")  


hist(y$age, xlab = "Mean of Age", main = "Distribution of Means of Age from Simulation")
abline(v = mga, col = "blue")  
abline(v = mean(d$age), col = "red")  

hist(y$weight, xlab = "Mean of Weight", main = "Distribution of Means of Weight from Simulation")
abline(v = mgw, col = "blue")  
abline(v = mean(d$weight), col = "red")

hist(y$zombies_killed, xlab = "Mean of Kills", main = "Distribution of Means of Kills from Simulation")
abline(v = mgz, col = "blue")  
abline(v = mean(d$zombies_killed), col = "red")

hist(y$years_of_education, xlab = "Mean of Education", main = "Distribution of Means of Education from Simulation")
abline(v = mge, col = "blue")  
abline(v = mean(d$years_of_education), col = "red")
  

```

Are they normally distributed? *not all of them, but age, height, and education appear to be.*

What about for those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution? *weight actually looks bimodal, so it's not a normal distribution, although I origianlly thought it was. I'm wondering if I parcelled out weight by gender if it would look like a normal distribution. The number of kills does not appear to be a normal distribution, but age, height, and education are more bell curve shaped.*
